# Garry's Mod - Github Menu Theme

## Disclaimer

This theme is released as is without guarantee and without support. The HTML for the main menu is a total mess and a nightmare to work with. This theme is not completed and **will remove some menus from your game such as "Find multiplayer game" and "Creations".** You may modify and redistribute this theme as you please.

This does not change the appearance of Source's menus, for that, see this project:\

For GMod's Derma components, see this project:\
